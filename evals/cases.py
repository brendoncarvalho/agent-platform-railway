"""
Eval Cases
==========

Each case sends one input to one agent and (optionally) checks two things:

- **judge** — `AgentAsJudgeEval` scores the response against `criteria`
  (binary pass/fail) using an LLM.
- **reliability** — `ReliabilityEval` checks which tools fired against
  `expected_tool_calls`.

Results are stored in Postgres via `eval_db` and are visible at os.agno.com

Add a case below, choose its profiles (`smoke`, `release`, `live`), then run
`python -m evals --profile <profile>`.
